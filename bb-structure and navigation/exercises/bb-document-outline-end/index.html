            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing to do is sign up and create or join a league. Once you’re in a league, you can pick which players you’d like to prioritize for the draft in case you’re not around. This is known as your autopick list. Next comes the draft which is when you actually pick your squad. It goes in turns with a time limit per turn. Once the draft is over, you can select your lineup and when the season starts, you’ll earn points for each of your players based on their weekly performances. You can change your starting lineup and make trades throughout the year.

            <h2>Picking a well balanced team. </h2>
            <p>
                This refers to both price and teams. Teams: Selecting your FPL team from a range of teams ensures you are well covered in the event that one side does particularly well or badly in any given weekend. Price: Ensure that the selection of 1-3 high price players is not at the expense of the rest of your team. It is important that not only 1-3 players are relied upon to score all of your points. If there is an injury, or if the players form drops, it can hurt your points in a big way.
