			<h2>What Is The Box Model</h2>
			<p>
				In this section the behavior is the same with "box-sizing" set to content-box or border-box. Both the content width and the box width are 1503.2px. The box height is 85.12px = h2 height + largest margin + paragraph height = 27.6px + 19.92px + 37.6px. This is called "margin collapsing".
			</p>

		<section class="margin-section">
			<h2>Margin</h2>
			<p>
				In this section the behavior is the same with "box-sizing" set to content-box or border-box. Both the content width and the box width are 1483.2px. They are smaller than the previous section because of the margin left and right.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="border-section">
			<h2>Border</h2>
			<p>
				In this section the behavior is the same with "box-sizing" set to content-box or border-box. The content width is 1491.2px but the box width is 1491.2 + 2*6px = 1503.2px. This is due to the border.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="padding-section">
			<h2>Padding</h2>
			<p>
				In this section the behavior is the same with "box-sizing" set to content-box or border-box. The content width is 1483.2px but the box width is 1483.2px + 2*10px = 1503.2px. This is due to the padding.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="width-section">
			<h2>Width</h2>
			<p>
				In this section the behavior is different. With "box-sizing" set to content-box, when setting the "width: 500px" means that the content width will be 500px, and the box width will be 500px + 2*10px + 2*6px = 532px. The box itself is placed in the "main" element according to the margin. With "box-sizing" set to border-box, when setting the "width: 500px" means that the box width will be 500px, and the content width will be 500px - 2*10px - 2*6px = 468px. This is very confusing. WE WILL ALWAYS USE BORDER-BOX, as overall it makes more sense to set the width of the box and not the content. Then the content will be auto sized according to the padding and border. In our future calculations we only need to think about the box width/height and the margins.
