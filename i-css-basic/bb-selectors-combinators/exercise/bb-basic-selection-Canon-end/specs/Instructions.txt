Start by creating a styles.css document in the css folder.

In your index.html document link the external style sheet.

Now create element selectors to target page elements and change the properties and values of the elements. Remember the purpose is for you to target and element using a selector not to style the content, though that is the result of changing the CSS properties.

Make box-sizing: border-box for all elements

Make the body element background-color to #F3FFFD

Select the h1 element and change the font-size property to 56px

Select the h2 elements and change the following properties:
 color to #3D403F
 text-decoration to underline

Select the three section elements and change the following properties:
 width to 650px
 border:1px solid black (this is the rule it has three values: border width, line style, and color)
 background-color to #F3FFF0

Select the paragraph elements change the following properties:
 font-family to Verdana
 font-size to 12px
