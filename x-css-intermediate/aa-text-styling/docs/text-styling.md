# Text Styling

Day 19 - Styling Text

- Explain the difference between web safe fonts (https://www.cssfontstack.com/) and external font libraries. 
- Demonstrate how to bring in Google Fonts using the link in the head of the HTML document. Be sure to bring in all fonts with one link and include the preconnect links for faster loading time.
- The order of elements in the head should be as follows: meta tags, title tag, preloads or pre-connects, stylesheets.
- Very important to include a default font style on the body element. This should be the paragraph font type so that it can inherit down to all elements (including paragraphs, labels, anchor tags, address text, etc).
- The heading font styles should be styled using global selectors (h1, h2, h3, etc) so that all of these elements are styled on all pages.
