  <h2>Quality guidelines</h2>
  <p>
    These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behaviour, but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assume that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.

  <h2>Champions League Quarter Finals</h2>
  <p>
    A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into the Bayern box. It’s a decent delivery, but there’s nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the greatest of ease from six yards!

    American Standard Sonoma White Rectangular Skirted Bathtub with Left-Hand Drain.
