            <h2>Shot Types</h2>
            <p>
                There is a convention in the video, film and television industries which assigns names and guidelines to common types of shots, framing and picture composition. The list below briefly describes the most common shot types (click the images for more details). The exact terminology varies between production environments but the basic principles are the same. Shots are usually described in relation to a particular subject. In most of the examples below, the subject is the boy. See below for more information and related tutorials.

                <h3>Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)</h3>
                <p>
                    In the extreme wide shot, the view is so far from the subject that s/he isn't even visible. The point of this shot is to show the subject's surroundings. The EWS is often used as an "establishing shot" - the first shot of a new scene, designed to show the audience where the action is taking place.It is also useful in scenes where the action is very spread out. For example, in a war movie an extreme wide shot can show the scale of the action. The EWS is also known as an extra long shot or extreme long shot (acronym XLS).

                <h3>Mid Shot (MS)</h3>
                <p>
                    The mid shot shows some part of the subject in more detail, whilst still showing enough for the audience to feel as if they were looking at the whole subject. In fact, this is an approximation of how you would see a person "in the flesh" if you were having a casual conversation. You wouldn't be paying any attention to their lower body, so that part of the picture is unnecessary.

                <p>
                    The MS is appropriate when the subject is speaking without too much emotion or intense concentration. It also works well when the intent is to deliver information, which is why it is frequently used by television news presenters. You will often see a story begin with a MS of the reporter (providing information), followed by closer shots of interview subjects (providing reactions and emotion).

                    <h4>Bridging</h4>
                    <p>In the movie Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom Steven Spielberg coined the term bridging. He would use many mid range shots followed by a simulated airplane in flight. Reportedly the production manager said that the sequence had more air miles than Sir Richard Branson</p>

                <h3>Close Up (CU)</h3>
                <p>In the closeup shot, a certain feature or part of the subject takes up most of the frame. A close up of a person usually means a close up of their face (unless specified otherwise). Close-ups are obviously useful for showing detail and can also be used as a cut-in. A close-up of a person emphasizes their emotional state. Whereas a mid-shot or wide-shot is more appropriate for delivering facts and general information, a close-up exaggerates facial expressions which convey emotion. The viewer is drawn into the subject's personal space and shares their feelings.

                    <h4>The Chocker Shot</h4>
                    <p>
                        A variation of the close up was first used in 1968 during the filming of Water Under the Bridge directed by Jackie Parker. It's immediate effect on the television and film industry was felt immediatly and the videographic technique so effective that it became know as the chocker shot in reference to the close up of the actors face from above the eyebrows to below the mouth.
