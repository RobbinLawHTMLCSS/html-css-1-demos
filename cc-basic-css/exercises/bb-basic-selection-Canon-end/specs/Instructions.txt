In your index.html document link the external style sheet.

Select the h2 elements and change the following properties:
 color to #3D403F
 text-decoration to underline

 width to 650px
 border:1px solid black (this is the rule it has three values: border width, line style, and color)
 background-color to #F3FFF0

 font-family to Verdana
 font-size to 12px
