        <h2>What Is Honey</h2>
        <p>
            A single cell of honeycomb is filled with the concentrated nectar of thousands of flowers, the healthiest and rawest form of honey available. A delicacy of nature straight from the source, our Raw Honeycomb is hand-cut from the frame and boxed, with no additional treatment or processing. Honeycomb paired with cheeses, fruit, and edible flowers is a gorgeous and delicious spread for guests. Honeycomb is 100% edible. KSA Kosher Certified.
