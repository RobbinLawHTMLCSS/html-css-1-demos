					<h2>The Start of Web</h2>
					<p>In the early 1990s, the internet was still in its infancy, and websites were primarily text-based. Simple layouts, reminiscent of printed documents, dominated the online landscape. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) played a pivotal role in defining the structure and organization of content on webpages. Tables were the primary method for arranging elements, leading to grid-like designs that lacked visual sophistication.</p>

					<h2>Rise of Flash and Multimedia</h2>
					<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, websites became more dynamic with the advent of Macromedia Flash. Flash allowed designers to create interactive and animated elements, revolutionizing the visual appeal of websites. Flash-based websites featured flashy intros, animated navigation menus, and immersive multimedia experiences. However, Flash had its drawbacks, including slow loading times and compatibility issues, leading to its eventual decline.</p>

					<h2>Web 2.0 and CSS</h2>
					<p>The emergence of Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s marked a significant shift in website layout design. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) gained popularity, enabling designers to separate content from presentation. This separation allowed for cleaner, more flexible layouts. Rounded corners, gradients, and drop shadows became common design elements. Websites embraced a more minimalist and user-friendly approach, emphasizing usability and readability.</p>

					<h2>Responsive Design and Mobile Approach</h2>
					<p>With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, the need for mobile-friendly websites became evident. Responsive web design emerged as a solution, enabling websites to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. This approach revolutionized website layout by prioritizing fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. Mobile-first design principles gained prominence, ensuring optimal user experiences across devices.</p>

					<h2>Flat Design</h2>
					<p>In the early 2010s, flat design gained traction, moving away from skewomorphic elements in favor of minimalistic aesthetics. Flat design employed clean lines, bold colors, and simple typography to create visually appealing layouts. This trend was further reinforced by Google's Material Design philosophy, which focused on tactile and responsive interfaces. Material Design introduced layers, shadows, and subtle animations to add depth and interactivity to websites</p>

As artificial intelligence and voice interfaces advance, designers are exploring new ways to create intuitive and context-aware layouts.</p>
