                    <p>One of the greatest advantages of bouldering is its accessibility. Bouldering gyms have sprung up worldwide, offering a safe and controlled environment for climbers of all levels. The absence of ropes and harnesses allows for greater freedom of movement, making it an excellent option for beginners or those who prefer shorter, intense bursts of climbing.</p>
