# Web Images with Figma

Day 20 - Intro to Figma and Web Image Formats

- Figma is free and students can use either the web version or download the app. Figma is pretty user friendly but walk students through importing a fig file, gathering info (especially text styles) from the properties panel, and how to export images.

- The different image file types:
  - SVG - this replaces the Gif. This will create a vector graphic that is drawn with XML code. These can be exported out of Figma
  - JPEG Compresses pretty well, good for high quality images and prefered over PNG.
  - PNG Does not compress as well as the JPEG, therefore making it a good choice only when transparency is needed.
  - The WebP has replaced both the JPEG and PNG formats and is used most often on the web now. Unfortunately, Figma does not have the option to export as WebP, therefore that file format will be covered in Web 2.

- NOTE: the exercise for the students to do on their own is to finish off the text styling on the demo. This will later be turned in for the next in-class lab, however the students do not need to complete the exercise in advance and there will be time for them to do it in the in-class lab.
